wavfix v0.1
===

Wavfix is able to repair broken wav files while preserving metadata.

Wavfix is built upon real case scenarios where files are corrupted during recording. Its ability to preserve metadata (all non-audio chunks) ensures software compatibility and workflow integrity, making wavfix useful in professional and broadcast environment.

Wavfix __will never overwrite your original files__, but will instead create new ones if needed. Using it is completely safe.

## Features

Works on __Linux__, __MacOS__ and __Windows__.

Wavfix currently supports the following :

* All standard __RIFF / WAVE__ PCM files.
* Preservation of ALL healthy chunks.
* RIFF header size recovery.
* &lt;data&gt; chunk size recovery.
* &lt;data&gt; chunk reconstruction if missing or corrupted.
* &lt;fmt &gt; chunk reconstruction if missing or corrupted.

wavfix, version 0.1 by Adrien Gesta-Fline

wavfix can repair corrupted wave files while keeping all meta-chunks intact.
Its  ability  to  preserve  metadata  ensures  software  compatibility  and 
workflow integrity.

usage : wavfix <options> broken_file.wav

    audio options :
        -f, --frequency   <n>     set frequency to n Hz (44100, 48000, etc.)
        -b, --bit-depth   <n>     set bit-depth to n bits (16, 24, 32, etc.)
        -c, --channels    <n>     set channels number to  n  channels (1 for
                                  mono, 2 for stereo, etc.)

        -F                        force using previous values instead of the
                                  ones contained in <bext> chunk if present.

    output options:
        -s, --suffix              repaired file names will  be  the same  as
                                  the broken ones plus this suffix.  Default
                                  is '_REPAIRED'.

    misc options :
        -N, --no-repair           use this option to only investigate files.
        -h, --help                display this help
```

## Examples

Simple file analysis, no repair :

```
$ wavfix -N file.wav
```
Analyse all files and repair if needed :

```
$ wavfix *.wav
```
If &lt;fmt &gt; chunk is missing and wavfix cannot detect audio parameters :

```
$ wavfix -f 48000 -b 16 -c 1 corrupted_file.wav
```

### Output Examples
Example from a malfunctioning __Sound Devices 552__ mixer :
```
$ wavfix ./SD552.wav

Example from a crashed __parecord__ recording :
```
$ wavfix ./PARECORD.wav

## Install

```
$ make
$ make install
```

## How to contribute

Feel free to report any bug, any recovery failure (or success !) so i can adapt the code to new cases.
